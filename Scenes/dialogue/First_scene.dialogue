~ Cave_1

The boyâ€™s eyes gradually focused and drifted in the barely lit cave as he appeared visibly confused and lost
[wait=.4]
He finally stared at his hands while he seemed to realize something as he thought
? : "who..."
? : "am.. I.?" 
His eyes seemed unfocused and purposeless while he gripped deep into his palm covered in bandages as if it would make it better
The boy explored the cave until he found an exit, each step he took felt ominous and distant.
